Synthetic Lethal Experiment 


## Background

Synthetic lethality (SL), an important type of genetic interaction in which the synthesis of mutations in the cell can lead to its death. Such a process can provide useful insights into the target identification for the development of anticancer therapeutics. Tumor‚Äêspecific synthetic lethality became targeted in research to improve cancer therapy although elucidating the synthetic lethality mechanism remains a challenge, because of the complexity of its influencing condition.  

Machine learning can assist in identifying these synthetic lethal gene pairs and therefore, we will be working on enhancing and developing a complete cascade of generating and qualifying the candidate lethal pairs.
